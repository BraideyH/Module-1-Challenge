# Horiseon Social Media Marketing

## Description

In this code refractory assignment, it was my goal to reduce the amount of nonsemantic lines of code while also consolidating various classes and attributes in a way that provides a cleaner look and aesthetic. In doing this, the HTML file flows with the CSS file in chronological order. Once the application met these standards, I included alt tags describing the images included within the webpage. The started code had many errors in the HTMl file including nonsemantic div tags that needed to be taken out and replaced with more logical and straight-forward elements- this is where many of the sections within the HTML needed to be included. The starter CSS file code contained 200 lines of code; I was able to reduce this down to 116, nearly cutting the size in half. 

## Installation

In order to cut such a large chunk out of the CSS and maintain a functional webpage, I first identified repeating attributes that could be consolidated down to one piece of code as opposed to three seperate lines found within the starter code. After this, I reviewed and made applicable changes to my HTML file so that the changes made within my CSS file would seamlessly flow over to the HTML, maintain functionality, promote accessibility, and increase optimization.

## Usage

The Navigation Bar includes interactable subject topics, acting similar to bookmarks, these topics take the viewer to the section of the application relavent to each topic.
